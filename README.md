# A Empirical Study of Suppressions of Static Analysis Warnings

## Structure of the *data* Directory

The *data* directory contains the following subdirectories, most of which are created by running the experiments:
 * *data/repos* contains the cloned repositories we study
 * *data/results* contains the results of running the experiments
 * *data/results/<repo_name>* contains all results for the repository *repo_name*
 * *data/results/<repo_name>/commits/<commit_id>* contains all results for a specific commit hash <commit_id>
